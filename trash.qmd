## Some logical operators

-   == (does this match?)

-   != (do these NOT match?)

-   \>, \<, \>=, \<=

-   &, \|

```{r}

# Does 4 match 5?
4 == 5


# Does 4 match 4?
4 == 4

# Does 4 NOT MATCH 5?
4 != 5

# Does 4 match "4"?
4 == "4"

# With assigned variables: 
cat <- 10
dog <- 7

cat > dog 

# Is dog greater than cat, OR is cat less than 20? 
dog > cat | cat < 20

# Is dog less than cat AND cat == 10
dog > (0.5 * cat)

dog < cat & cat > 2 & 4 >= dog
```

```{r}

```
